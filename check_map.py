# Map exists which all robot particles operate in
# Particles each have a motion model and a measurement model

# Need to sample:
#   Motion model for particle (given location of particle, map)
#           Motion model (in this case) comes from log + noise. 
#   Measurement model for particle (given location, map)
#           True measurements come from log
